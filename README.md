1. Download this repo.
2. Navigate to the project directory in the command line/terminal.
3. Run 'npm install' (or view the required dependencies listed in the package.json file and install each manually).
4. Run 'npm seed' to seed the SQLite database.
5. Run 'npm start' to start the application. (To test the Express server, browse to the URL: http://localhost:5000/)
6. Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for thorough route testing.

# Project objective
In this project, I created a REST API using Express. The API provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, as well as adding, updating and deleting courses in the database. Users are required to create an account and log-in to make changes to the database.

To complete this project, I used my knowledge of REST API design, Node.js, and Express to create API routes, along with the Sequelize ORM for data modeling, validation, and persistence. I used Postman to test explore and test routes during the development process. (The RESTAPI.postman_collection.json file is a collection of Postman requests used to test and explore the REST API.)
